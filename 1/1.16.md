I used render.com  it was very easy to pull my image from docker hub it automatically asigned the port 4000 to port 80 and provided a url 


this is the image i used 

```
leon00albert/encrypt:latest
```

This is the docker file i used 

```Dockerfile 
# Use official Node.js image as base
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Command to run the application
CMD ["node", "encrypt.js"]

```
